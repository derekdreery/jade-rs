jade-rs
=======

Nowhere near useable jade lib in rust.

Eventually it will take in jade as a string, and output either

  - a rust function, taking a hashmap (or something else) and outputting
    html
  - a string of javascript able to render the jade template as html
  - or a string of pure html

At the moment it does none of these things however.
